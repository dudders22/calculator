--Explanation of logic--.
For if I revisit this later on to polish it up! There are 3 global variables:

totalVal: 
Stores the running Total. 
Is reset if either AC is pressed, or a number is pressed without an operator

numberVal:
Stores the current number. This is reset when equals, AC, or any operator is pressed.
This flicks between being a string and a number to enable us to build it up.

operatorVal:
Stores the currently active operator. If null then there's no operator active.

1- If a number key is pressed:
    a- If numberVal already exists it will add a digit onto the end.
    b- If it doesn't it will start a new numberVal.

2- If an operator key is pressed (+-/*=):
    a- If there's a numberVal then:
        i- If there's no operator active, set totalVal to numberVal and clear numberVal.
        ii- if there is an operator active, set totalVal to the calculation, and clear numberVal.
    b- Sets the operatorVal active to +-/or* (not for equals)

3- If AC is pressed, or if we divide by zero then everything is reset.

There may be ways to break this that I've not thought of, but the code is quite easy to follow
compared to my previous monstrosities, and looks quite nice so I'm fairly happy with it!
